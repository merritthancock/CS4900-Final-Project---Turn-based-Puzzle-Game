# AndYetItCompiles - CS4900 Final Project
Welcome to our game!
This is a project for our Senior Seminar class in which we used Javscript and Threejs to build a turn-based puzzle game. The majority of the development for this project took place during the Spring 2020 semester, but this is still a working repository.
